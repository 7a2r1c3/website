        <h1 class="Summer_Title">Summer</h1>
        <p class="Summer_Text">Summer time is the most deadliest time for bushfires with the low humidity and extremely high temperatures.
            The hotter and the higher the humidity the easier it is for a bushfire to go out of control.
            With this sort of temperature, a bushfire can escalate extremely quickly and can brings homes, lives, 
            and towns to the threat of everything burning to the ground.</p>

        <h1 class="Autumn_Title">Autumn</h1>
        <p class="Autumn_Text">In Autumn, the temperature descalates and there it is more humid in the air so if a fire does start it will not be as
            hard to control as a fire in Summer. Most fires in Autumn might be a threat to lives and homes</p>

        <h1 class="Winter_Title">Winter</h1>
        <p class="Winter_Text">During Winter, is the unrestriced season where you can burn large piles of leaf litter without needed a permit.
            If a fire does escape, it will either extinguish because of rain or the fuel it is trying to burn is extremely
            wet. This time of the year is the easiest time to burn because of large amounts of rain and low temperatures.

        <h1 class="Spring_Title">Spring</h1>
        <p class="Spring_Text">During Spring, if you have a large enough property you will need to put in a firebreak. A firebreak is a 5 metre
            break from the edge of you property to give a small break where the fire cannot reach the property in that 5 metre
            break becaue their is no fuel there. You can still burn in the unrestricted season but at the begining of October
            you will have to have a permit issued by a Fire Control Officer at your local fire brigade to burn leaves or bush 
            in your property.
