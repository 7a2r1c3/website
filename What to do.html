    <div>
        <h1 class="Title1">Stay Connected</h1>
        <p class="Paragraph1">When a bushfire starts near your community or home. Anything can happen within a couple of minutes
        So you need to be connected to your local ABC radio for the latest updates or the Emergency WA website.
        These websites and this radio station, you can keep up to date and keep you out of reach of the bushfire.</p>
        <p class="Paragraph2">When a bushfire starts, you can do one of two things: Stay and Defend or Leave.</p>

    <div>
        <h1 class="Title2">Stay and Defend Or Leave</h1>
        <p class="Paragraph3">Staying and Defending means you have resources to fight a fire such as
            a water trailer and firebreaks installed help when defending your house from a bushfire.
            Some other resources you would need will be protective equipment so you don't inhale smoke
            or any fumes from a fire and clothing that is long-sleeved or fire retardant clothing so
             it doesn't burn next to flames.</p>
        <p class="Paragraph4">Leaving your house and property means you have to pack enough clothes
            and water to survive for a bit until you get to the nearest evacuation centre.
            When you do decide to leave, you need to take any clothes, water, all animals in cages
            for cats or dogs or floats for horses. There is a small chance that everything might be
            gone when you return so the best thing is to take all precious jewllery and heirlooms.</p>

    <div>
        <h1 class="Title3">Sheltering In Your Home</h1>
        <p class="Paragraph5">This option should be your last. Bushfires no matter when are unpredictable 
            and can change direction and intensity in a split second. No matter what, you should pe prepared
            to shelter in your home or shed, when every plan fails you have a backup plan in case you can't
            leave safely from your property.</p>
        <p class="Paragraph6">
            Firstly, remain in your home while the bushfire is passing over your house. Shelter in the farthest
            room from the fire. Make sure the room has at least two exits to the outside just in case, and a power
            and water supply. Many people have died because their was only one exit.</p>

    <div>
        <h1 class="Title4">Safe Places During a Bushfire</h1>
        <p class="Paragraph7">
            If you do decide to leave your home with your pets and valuables, you should consider places such
            as a local open space preferably near a body of water like a beach or an evacuation centre
            setup up by the state or local government.</p>
        <p class="Paragraph8">
            Remember that safe places do not guarantee safety in all circumstances. Safe places may not
            provide shelter from bushfire elements such as flying embers and heat, but aim for safe places
            that are far away from the fire front to not get burnt down or too far away so it would take
            ages to get back to your home if necessary.</p>
