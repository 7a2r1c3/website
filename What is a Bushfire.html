            <h2 class="Title1">Definition</h2>
            <p class="Paragraph1">
                A bushfire is a fire in scrub like dry grass and dry leaves as the "fuel" for the fire.
                This will spread rapidly across a hilly or flat landscape, no matter where you live.

            <h2 class="Title2">Types of Bushfires</h2>
            <p class="Paragraph2">
                There are three types of bushfires. For instance: Grassfires and Forest fires.
                Grassfires occur mainly on grazing, farming or remote scrub country. 
                This type of fire can destroy fences, livestock, homes, and people way of living.
                Forest fires occur in places that are usually hilly and woodlands/forests.
                Typically these fires cannot be stopped if they start in summer when it is hot, dry and extremely sunny.
            </p>

            <h2 class="Title3">Bushfire Prone Areas</h2>
            <p class="Paragraph3">
                Across WA, there are many bushfire prone areas which can be either in the flats like Wanneroo or the  hilly
                landscape of Mundaring. These places are prone to bushfires because of the amount of grass and trees in that town or 
                city. You can easily reduce the threats of a fire at your doorstep, by having a firebreak in place around 
                your property, if needed and burning overgrow grass every couple of years.

            <p class="Paragraph4">
                People across Australia and the world make mistakes but those mistakes can cause a snowball effect, like 
                a person using a grinder on a Total Fire Ban then the sparks from the grinder causes a fire then can threaten 
                lives and homes.

            <h3 class="Title5">Natural Causes</h3>
            <p class="Paragraph5">
                There are many causes for a bushfire, some can be accidental like human error, or it can be Natural causes
                like thunder striking the ground and starting a fire, because a lightning bolt has a lot of energy, when 
                it strikes the ground, it will usually start a fire.
